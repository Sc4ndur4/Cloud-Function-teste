# Google Cloud Functions
## Starting a new project
To start a new project in google cloud, we can go to
[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com) 
or [Google Cloud Plataform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
##Creating a virtual environment
First you have to install `python3-venv` with the following command:
``` 
Sudo apt install python3-venv
```
Then we execute the following command
```
pyhton3 -m venv venv
```
to activate the environment we do:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
In order to add new packages to our new virtual environment we create a file called `requirements.txt`and execute the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
